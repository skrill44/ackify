# Ackify

Ackify is a Discord bot designed to help communities manage important announcements and track task completion in a simple, reliable way.

It focuses on two core features:

• **Acknowledged announcements** — post messages that members must explicitly acknowledge
• **Checklists** — create and manage shared or personal task lists inside Discord

Ackify is built to be calm, minimal, and trustworthy — not flashy, not noisy, and not intrusive.

## Features

* Acknowledgment-based announcements
* Optional role-targeted announcements
* View who has and hasn’t acknowledged a message
* Remind members who haven’t acknowledged
* Create and manage checklists
* Lightweight, fast, and privacy-conscious

---

## Philosophy

Ackify is designed around clarity and accountability — not engagement tricks.

It avoids spam, avoids unnecessary pings, and avoids collecting unnecessary data.
The goal is simple: help servers run smoothly.

## Getting Started

Invite Ackify to your server and use `/announce` or `/checklist` to begin.

Example commands:
